commands to run

e.g. 
ansible-playbook -v -u o43872 -k   play_show_ver.yml


ansible-playbook -u o43872 -k play_collect_outputs.yml -v



Just   ansible-playbook play_collect_outputs.yml -v if using vars/credentials from hostfile--


-v is for verbose
-k is to get login prompt
-u xxx is providing username



To run the playbook,  invoke the vault this way:

 ansible-playbook play_show_ver.yml --vault-password-file ~/playbooks/vault-password-file -vv

    (vault-password-file is the file that has my encrypted password)
    (make sure the host file has ansible_connection=ssh) like this
